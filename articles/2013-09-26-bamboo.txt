title: Bamboo
date: 26/09/2013

Bamboo, pound for pound, has a greater tensile strength than steel.
Its one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, growing upwards of one
hundred feet tall. Bamboo is capable of withstanding tremendous weight
and force, bending to accommodate it. Bamboo's resilience is
inspiring, this and its many other attributes are those I strive to
instill in [Sensu](http://sensuapp.org), the open source monitoring
framework.
