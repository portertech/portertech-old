title: AWS re:Invent Submission
date: 26/07/2013

A few weeks ago, I submitted a session for AWS re:Invent 2013, "Monitoring
the ever changing". Limited to 400 characters, I sent the following:

Growing and contracting on demand, dynamic infrastructure introduces
monitoring challenges. Frequent application deployment and
configuration changes call for increased visibility and feedback. I
will share my methodologies for monitoring these ever changing
infrastructures. Instrumentation, configuration management as a source
of truth, self-service tooling, service checks at scale, and more.

Sessions will be finalized by early August.
